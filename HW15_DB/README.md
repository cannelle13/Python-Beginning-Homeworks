### HW: DB

Create a data model for an AirBnb.com system. Your model should give the ability to store information about the users, the rooms, the reservations, and the reviews. You should have two types of users:  
- Hosts
- Guests

The host should be able to create rooms with different attributes (amount of residents, price, A/C, refrigerator, etc.)
The guest should be able to make:
- Check the availability of any rooms
- Make a Reservation for a room.

For each table, you should describe what is the primary key and what are the foreign keys (if any).
The result of the work might be described in a table. You can create tables in a text file with the description of each field. You also can you any graphic tool that you might use to create a data model. I usually use DRAW.io for such things, but might choose another tool.

#### (Optional):
Add these possibilities for a guest:
- Pay for reservation
- Review for the host
