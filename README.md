## Assignment Folders

Each assignment folder contains a README file with a list of tasks that need to be completed. You will also find Python (.py or .ipynb) files within these folders, which contain my solutions to the assignments.
Feel free to explore the individual assignment folders for more details on each task. Indeed, these solutions might not be perfect, but I'm still learning. :)
